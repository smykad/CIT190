  <h3>Monkey D. Luffy</h3>
  <h4>Straw Hat Luffy</h4>
  <img src="media/luffy.png" alt="luffy" style="width: 141px; height: 288px;">
  <p><strong>Monkey D. Luffy</strong>, also known as <strong>"Straw Hat Luffy"</strong> <br>
    and commonly as <strong>"Straw Hat"</strong>, is the main <br>
    protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. <br> 
    He is the founder and captain of the increasingly <br>
    infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as <br>
    one of its top fighters. His lifelong dream is to <br>
    become the Pirate King by finding the legendary <br>
    treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger. He <br>
    believes that being the Pirate King means having <br>
    the most freedom in the world </p>

    <p> Born in Foosha Village, Luffy accidentally ate <br>
        the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his <br>
        body into rubber. He met "Red-Haired" Shanks, <br>
        who gave Luffy the very Straw Hat that has become <br>
        Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to <br>
        the boy as part of a promise for them to meet <br>
        again someday. Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary <br>
        leader Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of the Marine <br>
        hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of the <br>
        late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary <br>
        Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly <br>
        Dadan. He is one of the few people in the world <br>
        who carries the Will of D. </p>

  <h3>Roronoa Zoro</h3>
  <h4>Pirate Hunter Zoro</h4>
   <img src="media/zoro.png" alt="zoro" style="width: 141px; height: 288px;">
   <p><strong>Roronoa Zoro</strong>, also known as <strong>"Pirate Hunter" <br>Zoro</strong>, 
    is the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one <br>
   of their two swordsmen. Formerly a bounty hunter, <br>
   he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the <br>
   first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.</p>
   
   <p>As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship <br>
   style which he created during his childhood training <br>
   in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the three most <br>
   powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside <br>
   Luffy and Sanji. His dream is to become the greatest <br>
   swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise <br>
   he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.</p>
   
   <p>In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats <br>
   and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro is also regarded <br>
   as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the <br>
   "Worst Generation".</p>
   
   <p>He currently has a bounty of 320,000,000.</p>

  <h3>Vinsmoke Sanji</h3>
  <h4>Sanji</h4>
  <img src="media/sanji.png" alt="sanji" style="width: 141px; height: 288px;" >
  <p><strong>"Black Leg" Sanji</strong>, born as <strong>Vinsmoke Sanji</strong>, is the <br>
    cook of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the fifth member <br>
    of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the <br>
    end of the Baratie Arc.</p>
    
    <p>Born as the third son and fourth child of the <br>
    Vinsmoke Family (thus making him a former prince <br>
    of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, <br>
    once in his youth and again after reuniting with <br>
    them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a <br>
    child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as <br>
    the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain <br>
    until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to <br>
    join his crew.</p>
    
    <p>His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, <br>
    All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North <br>
    Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. <br>
    He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, <br>
    alongside Luffy and Zoro.</p>
    
    <p>He currently has a bounty of Beli.png330,000,000, <br>
    the third-highest in the crew after Luffy and Jinbe. <br>
    Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke, the World <br>
    Government labels it as part of his name on his <br>
    wanted poster.</p>
