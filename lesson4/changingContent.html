<h1>Douglas Adams Quotes</h1>
<p>“I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up<br> where I needed to be.”</p>
<p>“I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.”</p>
<p>“The story so far:<br>
    In the beginning the Universe was created.<br>
    This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.”</p>
<p>“I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I don't know the <br>answer”</p>
