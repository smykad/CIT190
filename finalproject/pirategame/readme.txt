Pirate Game
*******************
* PURPOSE OF GAME *
*******************

The purpose of this game is to survive as long as possible 
without getting hit by the oncoming objects

********************
* CURRENT PROBLEMS *
********************

I.  Collission detection needs to be implemented so that the ship can't go outside the canvas
	- To fix this I shall implement collission detection

II. Objects intended to be dodged are not removed upon leaving the canvas, causing memory issues over time
	- To fix this I shall remove the objects once they reach the y-axis

*******************
* FUTURE RELEASES *
*******************

I would like to improve the graphics of the objects you are dodging
